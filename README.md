### Hello, and welcome to my personal GitHub page! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Zakaria Zerrouki, and I am a recent MSc Mathematics graduate from the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor, and an aspiring quantitative analyst. I will be posting all of my coding side projects and any other contributions here on GitHub. Here are a few more facts about me:

- ðŸ”­ I am currently working on <a href = 'https://github.com/mzakariaz/Projects/tree/main/mathematics/Python'>Pure Mathematics</a> and <a href = 'https://github.com/mzakariaz/Projects/tree/main/quantitative_finance/Python'>Quantitative Finance</a> projects, and I intend to add more sophisticated ones, moving forward.
- ðŸŒ± I am currently learning all things Data Science and Machine Learning on <a href = 'https://www.datacamp.com/'>DataCamp</a>, where you can also view <a href = 'https://www.datacamp.com/portfolio/mzakariazerrouki'>my profile</a> and track my progress. The emphasis is on using the standard Python and R libraries, as well as database design using SQL. 
- ðŸ“« You can reach me via email at <a mailto = 'm.zakaria.zerrouki@gmail.com'>m.zakaria.zerrouki@gmail.com</a>.
- ðŸ’¬ My favourite subjects in Mathematics include Mathematical Analysis, Differential Geometry and Probability Theory.
- âš¡ Fun fact: LaTeX, which I also enjoy using (particularly the `fourier`, `mathdesign` and `tcolorbox` packages), is the first programming language I learned.
